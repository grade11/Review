in the worst case analysis, Comb Sort will run similar to bubble sort at O(N^2),
the reason this is true is because this sorting method has to swap the numbers at a slightly less amount of times
than bubble sort but still has to check if the array is sorted each time, so in the worst case analysis it runs at O(N^2)
